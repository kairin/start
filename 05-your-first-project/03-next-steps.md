## 🤔 Understanding Your Integrated Development Environment

### 🧩 How These Tools Work Together

Your development environment is an ecosystem where each tool helps the others. It's a beautiful thing! 🌈

###  कॉमन ट्रबलशूटिंग परिदृश्य

**"Command not found" after installation**: Your shell configuration hasn't reloaded. Run `source ~/.bashrc` or open a new terminal.

**Permission denied with npm**: You're not using NVM properly. Never use sudo with npm. Verify NVM is active with `nvm current`.

**VS Code can't find Git**: VS Code might be using the snap version. Ensure you installed the .deb version and restart VS Code.

**SSH key not working**: Ensure your SSH agent is running (`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`) and your key is added (`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

## 🚀 Next Steps in Your Development Journey
